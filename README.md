# rock_paper_scissors
"Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a quick game between you and the computer. Each round, you both choose one of three shapes: Rock (a fist), Paper (an open hand), or Scissors (a V with two fingers). Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both choose the same shape, itâ€™s a tie. Simple, fun, and strategic!
